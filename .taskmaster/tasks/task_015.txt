# Task ID: 15
# Title: Configure container build and security scanning pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up automated builds, image scanning, and security gates in CI pipeline
# Details:
Implement automated container image builds with multi-stage optimization. Configure image tagging and versioning strategies. Set up build caching for performance. Integrate Trivy, Snyk, or Aqua for vulnerability scanning in CI pipeline. Configure severity thresholds and blocking for critical vulnerabilities. Implement SBOM generation and image provenance tracking. Set up compliance scanning for regulatory requirements. Configure scan result reporting and remediation workflows. Document build procedures and security standards.

# Test Strategy:
Test automated builds complete successfully, verify vulnerability scanning blocks bad images, validate SBOM generation, test compliance scanning
