# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement OPA Gatekeeper, create constraint templates, and configure policy enforcement
# Details:
Deploy OPA Gatekeeper for automated policy enforcement. Create comprehensive constraint templates for security policies including pod security, resource limits, required labels, allowed container registries, and organizational compliance requirements. Configure policy violations to block non-compliant resources. Set up policy testing framework with automated tests. Implement compliance scanning for CIS Benchmark, PCI-DSS, and other standards. Create custom policies for organization-specific requirements. Set up policy violations reporting and alerting. Document all policies with rationale and remediation steps.

# Test Strategy:
Test policies block non-compliant resources, verify constraint templates work correctly, validate compliance scanning, test policy updates
