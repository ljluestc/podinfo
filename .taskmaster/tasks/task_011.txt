# Task ID: 11
# Title: Deploy service mesh for advanced traffic management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Istio or Linkerd with mTLS, traffic routing, and observability
# Details:
Deploy Istio or Linkerd service mesh. Configure automatic sidecar injection for all application namespaces. Implement mTLS for all service-to-service communication with automatic certificate rotation. Set up advanced traffic management rules (routing, splitting, mirroring). Configure circuit breakers, retry policies, and timeouts. Implement distributed tracing integration. Set up service mesh observability with metrics and dashboards. Configure security policies in service mesh layer. Document service mesh architecture and operational procedures.

# Test Strategy:
Verify mTLS is working between services, test traffic routing rules, validate circuit breakers, test distributed tracing, verify service mesh metrics
