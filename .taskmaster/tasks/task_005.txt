# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement network security and policies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: critical
# Description: Deploy CNI with NetworkPolicies, configure zero-trust networking, and implement network segmentation
# Details:
Deploy CNI plugin (Calico or Cilium) with NetworkPolicy support. Configure pod networking with custom CIDR ranges. Implement default deny-all NetworkPolicies for all namespaces. Create namespace-specific network policies with explicit ingress and egress rules. Configure network segmentation for multi-tenancy. Set up BGP routing for advanced networking scenarios. Implement network policy testing and validation framework. Document network policy architecture and templates.

# Test Strategy:
Verify NetworkPolicies block unauthorized traffic, test ingress/egress rules, validate network isolation between namespaces, test BGP routing
