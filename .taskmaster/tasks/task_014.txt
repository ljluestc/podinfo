# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitOps
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy ArgoCD or Flux, configure automated deployments, and implement progressive delivery
# Details:
Deploy GitOps operator (ArgoCD or Flux CD). Configure Git repositories as single source of truth. Implement automated deployment from Git with branch-based environments. Set up deployment approvals and gates. Configure automated rollback on failures. Implement progressive delivery with canary and blue-green deployments using Flagger or Argo Rollouts. Set up deployment notifications and status reporting. Configure drift detection and automated remediation. Implement multi-cluster GitOps management. Document CI/CD workflows and procedures.

# Test Strategy:
Test automated deployments work, verify rollback procedures, validate progressive delivery, test drift detection, verify multi-environment deployments
