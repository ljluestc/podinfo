# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up base cluster infrastructure and architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: critical
# Description: Deploy highly available Kubernetes cluster with HA control plane, etcd cluster, and worker node pools
# Details:
Deploy multi-node Kubernetes cluster with minimum 3 master nodes for HA control plane. Configure etcd cluster with TLS encryption and automatic backups. Set up API server with audit logging, configure scheduler with custom policies, deploy controller manager with leader election. Provision worker node pools with auto-scaling, configure node taints/labels for workload isolation. Implement node monitoring, health checks, and lifecycle management.

# Test Strategy:
Verify cluster components are healthy, test HA failover scenarios, validate etcd backups, confirm node auto-scaling works, test node lifecycle operations
