## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.1 Overview
This PRD captures the requirements and implementation details for OTEL: Readme.

### 1.2 Purpose
This document provides a structured specification that can be parsed by task-master to generate actionable tasks.

### 1.3 Scope

## 2. REQUIREMENTS


## 3. TASKS

The following tasks have been identified for implementation:

**TASK_001** [HIGH]: PodInfo Frontend on port 9898

**TASK_002** [HIGH]: PodInfo Backend on port 9899

**TASK_003** [HIGH]: OpenTelemetry Collector listening on port 4317 for GRPC

**TASK_004** [HIGH]: Jaeger all-in-one listening on multiple ports

**TASK_005** [HIGH]: Start all the Containers

**TASK_006** [HIGH]: Send some sample requests

**TASK_007** [HIGH]: Visit `http://localhost:16686/` to see the spans

**TASK_008** [HIGH]: Stop all the containers


## 4. DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS

### 4.1 Original Content

The following sections contain the original documentation:


#### Tracing Demo

# Tracing Demo

The directory contains sample [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector)
and [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io) configurations for a tracing demo.


#### Configuration

## Configuration

The provided [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) sets up 4 Containers

1. PodInfo Frontend on port 9898
2. PodInfo Backend on port 9899
3. OpenTelemetry Collector listening on port 4317 for GRPC
4. Jaeger all-in-one listening on multiple ports


#### How Does It Work 

## How does it work?

The frontend pods are configured to call onto the backend pods. Both the podinfo
pods are configured to send traces over to the collector at port 4317 using GRPC.
The collector forwards all received spans to Jaeger over port 14250 and Jaeger
exposes a UI over port `16686`.


#### Running It Locally

## Running it locally

1. Start all the Containers
```shell
make run
```
2. Send some sample requests
```shell
curl -v http://localhost:9898/status/200
curl -X POST -v http://localhost:9898/api/echo
```
3. Visit `http://localhost:16686/` to see the spans
4. Stop all the containers
```shell
make stop
```
