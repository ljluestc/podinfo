#### Testing Locally Using Kind

## Testing Locally Using Kind

> NOTE: You can install [kind from here](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)

The following will create a new cluster called "podinfo" and configure host ports on 80 and 443. You can access the
endpoints on localhost. The example also deploys cert-manager within the cluster along with a self-signed cluster issuer
used to generate the certificate to validate the secure port.

```sh
./kind.sh
```
